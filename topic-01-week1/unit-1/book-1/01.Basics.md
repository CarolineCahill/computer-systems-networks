# Using the CLI

Beginners Shell Scripting

## Linux commands

A command is a software program that when executed on the CLI (command line interface), performs an action on the computer.

- When you type in a command, a process is run by the OS that can read input, manipulate data and produce output.

## EXERCISE

- Open the **Terminal** so you are now using the CLI

The **ls** command displays a listing of information about files

 Type the following command

```bash
$ls
```

Next, follow on with these very common commands, executing them one at a time, *taking note of the action performed by each command*:

```bash
$ls -l
$pwd
$mkdir Hdip
$ls -l
$mkdir hdip
$ls -l
$cd June
$pwd
$cd ../
$pwd
$rmdir Hdip hdip
$ls -l
$who
$date
$echo Hello World
$echo Hello World on `date`
```

## TIP: Be careful of the Basics

1. Linux IS **case sensitive** - be careful with filenames and commands
Try out the **LS** command?

2. Become familiar with naming conventions i.e. no spaces

## TIP 2: Use the Manual

There is a very comprehensive manual included which can be used simply by the ***man*** command followed by the name of any command to provide a detailed view of the command.

For example, to view the manual for the ***who*** command, type

```bash
man any_command_name
```

## TIP 3: Include Comments in your code

The Shell Programming language would not be complete without ***comment statements***.

- Like with any programming language, a comment statement allows you to insert remarks or comments about your program without it having any effect on its execution.

- Whenever the shell encounters the special character **#** at the beginning of a word or line, it takes whatever characters following the **#** as comments, and simply ignores the content

```bash
# Author: C Cahill
# Program Description:
# This program calculates the amount of CPU usage of each user ……<blah, blah>…
```

Comments are especially useful for documenting commands or sequences of commands whose purpose may not be obvious.

## TIP 4: Use a Text Editor

You can use any text editor to creating a Shell Script File

1. **Visual Studio Code** is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, macOS and web browsers

2. **nano** is a command-line text editor.

3. **gedit** is a good graphical alternative

~**Please Note**~

For most of my notes, I will use **nano** as my editor, but that's totally up to you - preference and/or previous experience. The final output of a file will still be the same whichever editor you choose!

## What is a “Shell Script”

- In Linux, it is sometimes necessary to perform ***a number of*** complex shell commands, often repetitively, to achieve an overall result.

- can be very tedious and time consuming.

Storing commands in a script that can interact with the user, repeat commands and make decisions is known as **“Shell Scripting”** or **“Shell Programming”**.

So, for example, you could create a simple front end for re-use, like this:
