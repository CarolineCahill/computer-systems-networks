## 'numusers' script

You want to create a *reusable* script to return back the number of user logged into the system

- Create a file called **numusers** using your preferred editor, say **nano**

The syntax - **editor name** followed by the **filename** i.e.:

```bash
$nano numusers
```

- Add shell command(s) to the file using the nano editor:

```bash
echo Welcome to the system. The current number of users logged in are:

who | wc â€“l
```

- Save the file

```bash
CTRL+O
```

- Exit the file

```bash
CTRL+X
```

- Run your script - execute the commands contained in the file **numusers** i.e.:

```bash
$./numusers
```

So what went wrong here?? Are you also getting this message?:

```bash
bash: ./numusers: Permission denied
```
