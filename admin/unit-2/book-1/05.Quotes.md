# Executable Scripts

## Shebang line

The program that shall interpret your script is determined in your scripts first line, called the **shebang** line, which if you recall, should contain:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

## Comments

With the exception of the shebang line, the hash symbol, **#**, indicates a comment.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is a comment!
echo Hello
```

So all files should include, at least:
```bash
# Author: C Cahill
# Program Description:
# This program calculates the amount of CPU usage of each user ………
```

# PRACTICE Create a script to welcome the user

 Creating a script to welcome the user on the current date

**nano** is a command-line text editor that I will primarily use for class.
(**gedit** is a good graphical alternative but I will be sticking with **nano**)

1.Firstly, from the Terminal, create the new file  **welcome** to be edited in the **nano** editor:

```bash
$nano welcome
```

2.Next, type the shebang line and a brief comment that indicates the overall content of the file. Complete the file with your command(s) i.e. include a call to output the system USER variable

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is the...... file!
echo Great to see you USER on date 
```

3.Exit the file (saving any changes)

```bash
CTRL+X and save changes (Y)
```

4.Execute the script

```bash
$./welcome
```

I expect you will see something similar to this:

```bash
$bash: ./welcome: Permission denied
```
```bash
$ chmod 755 welcome #change file permissions
$ ./welcome #run the script again

```

If there's any errors, review the code & try fix them?

# Quoting

Try it yourself - take note of the different uses:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This is a comment!
echo Hello      World $USER
echo "Hello      World"
echo "Hello World"
echo Hello * World
echo "Hello * World"
echo "Hello" World
echo Hello "     " World
echo "Hello "*" World"
echo `hello` world
echo 'hello' world
a=2000
echo '$a'
echo "$a"
```
