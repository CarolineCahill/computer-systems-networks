# File Hierarchy and Navigation

File system hierarchy Â· Directory Navigation

PLEASE NOTE: generally in my notes do NOT type the **$** sign; this is just shorthand for the command line prompt

## Objectives

On successful completion, you should have a good insite into the importance of having experience in scripting, be able to navigate your Linux file hierarchy, understand common commands and be able to work with and manipulate new files and directories

You should also be able to take and make use of some **user input** in files.

## As always, please feel free to interact on the "computer-systems" channel on Slack
