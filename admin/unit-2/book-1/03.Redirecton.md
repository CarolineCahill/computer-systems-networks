# Creating files using `>` redirection

With lots of directories and no files at the moment, let's redirect the output from a command so that, instead of being printed to the screen (which is the standard output, or `STDOUT`), it is redirected to a new file

This is how your files structure should look:
![File structure](img/hierarchyEgFull.png)

Move (`cd`) into your `Part1` directory

Make another subdirectory inside `Part1` called `Outputs` 

From within the `Outputs` directory, enter the follow commands... what's happening?

```bash
$ls
$ls ../../
$ls ../../ > output.txt
$ls
```

## View contents of a file using `cat` 

We can use the **cat** command to look at the content of a file (which should be the redirected STDOUT of `ls`):

```bash
$cat output.txt
```

## Redirect the `echo` command

```bash
echo "This is a test" > test_1.txt
echo "This is a second test" > test_2.txt
echo "This is a third test" > test_3.txt
ls
```

Now, **cat** (con**CAT**enate) to view the outputs:

```bash
cat test_1.txt test_2.txt test_3.txt
```

## Wildcards

File globbing is a feature provided by the Linux shell to represent multiple filenames by using special characters called wildcards with a single file name.

Where you want to pass multiple file names to a single command:
 -  A question mark ("**?**") can be used to indicate “any single character” within the file name
 -  An asterisk ("*") can be used to indicate “zero or more characters”. 
 - Square brackets (**[]**) can be used to represent and match for the character enclosed within the square brackets

TRY OUT 

```bash
cat test_1.txt test_2.txt test_3.txt
```
```
cat test_?.txt
“any single character” within the file name
```
```
cat test_*
cat t* > combined.txt
indicate “zero or more characters” so will redirect all outputs to combined.txt 
``` 
```
cat combined.txt
```

### TIPS - you don't want to OVERWRITE FILES

*BE EXTRA CAREFUL when using redirection to make sure that you don’t **accidentally OVERWRITE file(s)** you need*

- The shell clears out all the content of the file before it writes the output of your **cat** command into it.

## Append (`>>`) rather than replace (`>`) 

If you do want to append to, rather than replace, the content of the files, double up on the greater-than character:

```bash
cat t* >> combined.txt
echo "I've appended a line, no overwriting here!" >> combined.txt
cat combined.txt
```
