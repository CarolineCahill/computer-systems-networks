# EXER: Add System Info to your **numusers** script

Recall your script that prints the date and time, the number of users logged in, and your current working directory.

By now you should have made the output of this script a bit more user friendly through the use of the shell command `echo`

Do you have:

 - a shebang line
 - a comment incl your name and a brief description of to the script?

```bash
$nano <<filename>>  #Open your file in nano editor

echo Hi $USER and welcome to Computer Systems
echo The current time and date is:
date
echo
echo The number of users on the system is:
who | wc â€“l
echo
echo Your current working directory is:
pwd
```

Extract and output **any** system information of your choice, using commands such as:

- `lscpu`,
- `hwinfo`,
- `df`,
- `free -m`, and
- the `cpuinfo` and `meminfo` (both within the `proc` directory)

Execute this script to ensure the outout is as you expected

# EXERCISE: Create a template script

Create a new `template.sh` file in your `Assessment 1 Files` directory 

This is to contain basic reusable details that you will need for all bash shell scripts i.e.

1. a shebang line
2. some intro comments that include, at least, your name, your student ID and a space for comments on a description of your script
3. check that the file will execute by adding some output to the screen (maybe a simple hello to the system user)
4. Change the file permissions for this template and all files in the `Assessment 1 Files` directory to read, write and execte for all groups
