## Introduction

The main purpose of this lab is to set up your laptop/workstation with the main software packages used in this module

1. Windows now comes with Windows Subsystem Linux(WSL).
2. MacOS has Bash built in.
3. Alternatively, you could choose to install **Virtualbox** and then install **Ubuntu Operating System** into this virtual machine. 

```
Choose **one** of the three options above.
```

On successful completion, you should have a "platform independent" environment to complete the labs and assignments irrespective of the type of machine/operating system you use.

There is a "computer-systems" channel on Slack so if you've any issues with the lab you can interact with us there.
