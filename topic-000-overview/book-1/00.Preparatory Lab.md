# Objectives

**WSL Â· Bash Â· Linux**

## Introduction

The main purpose of this lab is to set up your laptop or workstation with some software tools used in this module.

You have three setup options, depending on your operating system:

1. **Windows**: Use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which allows you to run a Linux environment directly on Windows.
2. **macOS**: Bash is already included, so you can use the built-in terminal.
3. **Other options**: Install **VirtualBox** and set up an **Ubuntu** virtual machine.

ðŸ‘‰ **Choose only one of the options above**. If you're using WSL on Windows or macOS, you do **not** need to install VirtualBox. Also

### A Note on Bash

**Bash** (Bourne Again SHell) is a command-line interface that's used to interact with your operating system using text-based commands. Itâ€™s widely used in **Linux** and macOS environments and is used for scripting, automation, and working with software development tools. Using Bash will give you more command-line experience and skills that will be useful both in this and other modules on the programme. Command line/bash is everywhere!

Once you're set up, you'll have a working environment for first part of this module. If you run into any problems, let us know on the `#computer-systems` channel and we'll be happy to help.
