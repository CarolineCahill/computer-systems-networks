# 1. Virtualbox v6.1

## Consistent OS for you

I strongly advise that you install a virtual Linux environment which will essentially be a computer within your laptop, in particular if you are new to the environment.

**WHY?** By using one consistent environment for the entire course we can avoid most of the boring problems and concentrate on the meat of the course instead. 

## STEP 1: Download and install Virtualbox

Virtualbox is a *virtualisation hypervisor* which provides an environment to create and provision virtual machines.

You will be using Virtualbox to explore machine virtualisation and operating systems. This and subsequent labs have been developed and tested using **version 6.1**. 

To keep your development environment consistent with the labs, **you are advised to install this version**.

Select the appropriate download and install Virtualbox 6.1 for your operating system:

- [Windows](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.8/VirtualBox-6.1.8-137981-Win.exe)
- [OS X](https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/6.1.8/VirtualBox-6.1.8-137981-OSX.dmg)
- [Linux](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)

Ensure that Virtualbox has installed correctly by starting the application on your machine.

All going well you should see something similar to the following:
