## What is Ubuntu?

![Ubuntu Meaning](./img/ubuntuMeaning.png)

- Ubuntu is free/Libre Open-Source Software
- Ubuntu uses the ***Linux kernel***

The Linux kernel on its own, is not an operating system, but rather a set of computer instructions, that enable communication between software applications and the data processing done at the hardware level.

- LUbuntu is simply a **L**ightweight computer operating system based on **Ubuntu**.
