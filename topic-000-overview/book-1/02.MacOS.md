## Running a Bash Shell: MacOS

MacOS has Bash built in. You just need to make sure you're using the correct terminal dialect on the command line (you did this in [Web Dev](https://reader.tutors.dev/#/lab/wit-hdip-comp-sci-2022-web-development.netlify.app/topic-07-starting-play/unit-1/book-b-setup-play/03) last semester)

To see which dialects are available. Open a Terminal and enter:

```bash
cat /etc/shells
```

The response will be:

```bash
# List of acceptable shells for chpass(1).
# Ftpd will not allow users to connect who are not using
# one of these shells.

/bin/bash
/bin/csh
/bin/dash
/bin/ksh
/bin/sh
/bin/tcsh
/bin/zsh
```

Recent versions of MacOS have been set `zsh` as the default. However, for this module (and subsequent modules in the programme), `bash` is more appropriate. To change the use the `bash` shell by default, enter the following:

```bash
chsh -s /bin/bash
```

You will be asked for your password - and then all future terminals will use the `bash` shell.
